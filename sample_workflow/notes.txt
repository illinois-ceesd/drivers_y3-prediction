A brief description of each step.

################
(Argon) cold flow
################

step1:  Initialization and stabilization
				ideal gas, single species, constant transport, no injection

step2: switch to realistic transport, power law transport
step3: switch to multi-species, N2/O2,
step4: elevated wall timescale to reach ARC activation

#######
ARC on
#######
			
step5: elevate stagnation pressure/temperature
step6: elevated wall timescale to reach injection start

#######
Fuel injection on
#######
			
step7: begin fuel injection, add full reaction mechanism
step8: elevated wall timescale to reach ignition

#######
Combustion
#######
			
step9: ignition and to sustained combustion
step10: elevated wall timescale to for full wall heating
